Hy I'm here to only for the improvements, do not reduce any features... We'll only fix existing features and improve and add some good mechanism and features.... Study the repo it is good... But there is some problems like... When the bot is doing a process and i click any button sometimes it's not clicked or not worked cause of floodwait, i think you can fix these floodwait problems.. and i want you to improve this and i don't want to wait like this,  also heroku has a restart cycle every day so we don't know when my bot can stop work and get again restarted so and this can cause loose of backup right so when the bot is downloading and uploading continuously it should give backup file at every 30 min so that even if don't click manually the backup automatically comes and i don't need to think about heroku cycle or restart... And this getting a backup or clicking the backup button should not cause floodwait problems... No buttons should cause any floodwait problems i think this issue can be fixed and improved... All existing features will be improved not any downgrade.. also add a button in a batch where I can reset the settings and database for the batch... After clicking the reset I can again restart the batch settings from the new... Floodwait issue should be resolved from all buttons whether it refresh or any other button.. i want smoothness not stuckness, also improve the download speed
